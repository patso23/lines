   <div class="tcontainer">
    <p style="font-size:.8em; text-align: right;">Updated: 06-11-2014</p>
    <h2>Purchase Terms</h2>
    <p>
     Your purchase, activation, and use of GIV Mobile’s products or services indicate that you accept, acknowledge and agree to the following terms and conditions. 
     The discounted package requires the purchase of a qualifying phone, two (2) months of airtime (you may select the $40 or $50 unlimited plan), and a SIM Card. 
     You may elect to purchase more than two (2) months of airtime, however this must be done at the time of purchase. An account setup fee of $25 is applied at the 
     time of checkout. This package requires that you set up autopay when you activate your service. . Upon checkout, you will be enrolled into the GIV Mobile autopay 
     service which takes effect once you have activated service with GIV Mobile. The phone must be activated on GIV Mobile service. Use of the device on another service 
     provider is expressly prohibited, and will result in a charge of the full price of the phone. Package models may vary.
    </p>
    <h2>Refund/Replacement/Warranty Information</h2>
    <p>
     Phones can be returned within 30 days of the date of activation or prior to the use of 300 minutes of airtime, whichever occurs first. Once service has been 
     activated, airtime may not be refunded. If service is canceled or autopay is disabled within the first sixty-one (61) days of service you will be charged the 
     full price of the phone. Phones are covered by a 30 day return/exchange policy for mechanical failure. The policy expires 30 days from the initial activation 
     of service. We reserve the right to inspect the items for damage and use. Any items that are returned in a damaged condition will not be accepted. Please note 
     that the warranty will be void and/or not be eligible for refund, replacement or exchange if products returned are physically damaged. GIV reserves the right 
     to change the return policy terms without prior notice. Visit givmobile.com for additional details.
